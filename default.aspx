			<h4><a href="census.aspx">Transcribed Census Data</a></h4>
			Our census page provides information on existing transcribed census data. However, several have not been transcribed nor indexed and the process of doing so has become non-cost effective. Data is available for 1850, 1870, 1880, 1900, and 1930. Fortunately, the townships of Clinton have had their census data transcribed which can be sifted through or searched with the search box above.
			<h4><a href="cemeteries.aspx">Cemeteries, Graves, and Obituaries</a></h4>
			The cemeteries page provides links to searchable cemetery indexes as well as a custom made map locating various cemeteries. The Clinton County Cemeteries map uses coordinates provided by Find-A-Grave and may not be 100 percent accurate. Each point on the map provides a link to the Find-A-Grave website and tells you how many are buried. Several did not provide coordinates and are listed below the map. If address or coordinates can be provided please contact to update the map. 
			<h4><a href="vitals.aspx">Vital Statitics</a></h4>
			The vitals page provides contact information for several records offices and the history of newspapers in the region. 
			<h4><a href="resources.aspx">Clinton County Resources</a></h4>
			Several resources are provided for Clinton County, families of Clinton, and Pennsylvania in general.
